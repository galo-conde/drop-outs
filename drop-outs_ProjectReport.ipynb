    "\n",
    "There is little contest refuting the notion that decreasing educational funding negatively impacts the success of students. Public schools rely on a combination of local, state, and federal sources of funding their educational programs. These allocations change year to year depending on the current political climate and economic circumstances. Our overall objective is to design and evaluate predictions of which educational program's funding change will have the biggest impact on drop-out rates. \n",

    "In this project we will use Common Core of Data (CCD) provided by the U.S. Department of Education. The model will be designed using the National Public Education Financial Survey Data and State Dropout and Completion Data from year 2002-2007. We will test the predictive qualites of the model against 2008-2010 to evalute the validity of our predictions.\n",
    "A possible obstacle in creating the model will be missing data due to the creation or discountinuation of educational programs year to year. Additional complications may arise when testing the model against data from years correspinding to the unsual economic circumstances of the Great Recession. \n",

    "**Abstract** :\n",
    "School funding is a ubiquitous issue. The yearly allocation of educational resources most clearly impacts students and their parents however those far removed from the public school system are not precluded from suffering the effects of budget cuts and misappropriations. As there is clear correlation between graduation and unemployment rates, failing to invest in programs that keep students engaged and interested in school causes measurable detriments to our economy, and in turn, to our society. In this project machine learning techniches are employed to identify which sources of funding and respective allocations made the most impact on dropout rates in the southern region of the US. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In the US there are many schools that lack the fund to give students a maximal education. Lack of funding to schools can lead the students to be less motivated with their education. It can also lead to poor teaching staffs that are ill-equipped to motivate students. Students who drop out of high school are less likely to find be successful in life because as many jobs that require a basic high-school education. It is possible that the way some fundings are allocated can hurt the schools effectiveness in reducing the number of student who dropout from the schools. This project will explore how spending decisions that can help or exacerbate number of drop outs in these high schools by using machine learning models. \n",
    "    \n",
    "The source of our data is the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES). They are the primary federal entity that collects data related to public elemtary and secondary education. From this organization we used the National Public Education Financial Survey for documenting financial data and the State Dropout and Completion Data. The purpose of the National Public Education Financial Survey is to provide descriptive information about revenues and expenditures for public elementary and secondary education. The State Dropout and Completion Data contains state-level counts of students who drop out and complete high-school. The data in both of these data sets are recorded by state education agencies so each line of data is represented by the state \n",
    "   \n",
    "Our research question deals with finding a correlation between how funds are distributed and the dropout rate in high school. We will examine the National Public Education Financial Survey and the State Dropout and Completion Data to determine if distributions of finance impacts dropout rates. The main features we will be examining is the school finance data are the distribution of expenditures to each state and the proportion of revenues to each state schools. Expenditures are funds that the school spends and the finances data shows how the expenditures are distributed. This makes it easy to calculate the percentage of certain expenditures to others. The expenditures we will focus on are expenditures to instructional staff, support services, school administration and general administration. The revenue consist of revenue that is funded to the schools at the state level, local level, and the federal level. percentage of local, state and federal revenue can be calculated using the finance data. The main features we will use in the dropout data is the average drop out rate 9-12 and each individual dropout rate 9-12.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem Statement \n",
    "Our Benchmark is to look at the manner of funds distributed by each state we will see how the nature of expenditures and revenue distributed amongst states can effect the dropout rate. We choose this bench mark to see if we can examine that low drop out rates occur due to a lack of support on funding for teachers. We are also curious on other financial proportions can effect drop out rates. So we choose several features to measure as a correlation to drop out rates. We hope that the strongest correlation in the correlation matrix will be the proportion of expenditures to instructional staff and drop out rates. We also hope to get a strong correlation.\n",

    "### Related Work\n",
    "\n",
    "In the past few decades researchers are finding that not only the amount of funding that affect dropout rates but also their allocation. In examining the impact of extracurricular programs have on student success, studies in the past decade link arts education to improving academic outcomes and lowering dropout rates, particularly for at-risk students (Brown.) Vocational Training programs prove to have similar impact on student engagement and drive down dropout rates. (ACTE) However, as budget are reformulated every year according to changes in funding and the overall economic climate, cuts often force school districts to reduce or eliminate extracurricular programs and lay-ff support staff like counselors, thus aggravating the problem. (Chen) \n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Management\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of the data set is to observe the manner each state receives and spends funds and the drop out rates that occur with in each of these states. The data set was created by the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES). This is the lead federal entity that calculates consistent data on Americas education system. The data sets that we are using are the National Public Education Financial Survey and State Dropout and Completion Data. Built our data set based off of this. Each of these data sets are recorded on the state level. \n",
    "\n",
    "One of our goals in this project was to determine if a state being a southern state can effect the dropout rate at all. For this reason we used the data sets who rows where separated by state or province. The struggle with using these data sets, is that there is a-lot of data that varies based on the amount of schools that the state has. If we were to look at a chart that consist revenue for school funding to each state, they would be different based on the population of the state because heavier populated states contain more schools. We discovered this problem when make examining our first correlation match that contain correlations that were too good to be true. We decided to resolve this issue by not making about looking at total revenue but about looking at the \n",
    "\n",
    "The National Public Education Financial Survey has the total expenditure spent by each state, but they also have proportions of these expenditure spending. The same goes for other features such as the total amount of revenue that each state received and separate features that represent the amount of local , state, and federal revenue. The data set also provided information on how these fundings are distributed. The Total Revenue from all sources is the (local + federal + state + other sources). The proportion of revenue was calculated by dividing each of these features by the Total Revenue from all sources. There is a feature that contains the total expenditure from the state and subtotals expenditures. The subtotals make up the total expenditure. The subtotal expenditures consist of support expenditure from student support serves, instructional staff support, general administration, school administration, operation and maintenance, pupil transportation and total support services. The subtotals are also separated based on the the specifics of where the money is going to so we analyzed the money spent on salaries and supplies for these expenditure salaries.\n",
    "    \n",
    "The State Drop out data contains features that were calculated drop out rates for each state. We added the drop out rate for the 9th, 10th, 11th, and 12th grade individually. We also used the feature, dropout rate 9-12 to measure that overall dropout rate from grade 9 through grade 12. The data set also had the total dropouts for each state but we did not want to use these features for our data. Because each state has a different amount of schools, the total amount of dropouts will be greatly effected by this feature and will lead to bad results. To see if there were any geographical contributions to dropout rates, we also marked which state was southern. The column SOUTHERN denotes wether a state is in the south or not. If the value within the southern column is 1, then it is souther and 0 otherwise. We initially had regular diploma count but when we began to create machine learning models we dropped it and focused only on dropout rates. \n",
    "    \n",
    "The list of features used for our data are listed below below:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Dropout Rate, Grades 9-12\n",
    "* Count of dropouts grade 10\n",
    "* Count of dropouts grade 11\n",
    "* Count of dropouts grade 12\n",
    "* Dropout Rate (Grade 10)\n",
    "* Dropout Rate (Grade 11)\n",
    "\n",
    "The NCES  has National Public Education Financial Survey data from the years 1986 to 2019 but we were not able to use all of these data sets when matching it with the drop out data. The drop out data does not clear nearly as many years as the financial data. As a result we were only able to use the data from 2007 to 2010. The data set included territories and district such as the district of Columbia, so we discarded these rows. Some of the data contained values of -1,-2. These were indications of null values so we had to get rid of them by replacing them with zero. After incorporating all of the states from year 2007-20010 we had a shape of (204, 30).\n",

    "### Data Description\n",
    "We we used the Describe() method from python to find out how we should categorize the Dropout rate, grade 9-12. We saw the the mean of the dropout rate is 3.6, the standard deviation is 1.6, the min is 1.1, the standard deviation at the 25 percentile is 2.4, 50 percentile  is 3.4, and 75 percentile is at 4.5. We choose to categorize the data based on states with low dropout rates. So we choose 2.4  to be the cutoff for the Dropout rate. So a feature was added to our data base consisting of either a 1 or a 0. If the value was a 0 then the drop out rate was above or equal to 2.4 and if the value is 1 if the dropout rate 9-12 is below 2.4. We also dropped feature that we deemed were useless to our results. The only features that we have now are the proportion of support expenditures to general administration, expenditures of salaries to general administration, and support expenditures to supplies to general administration. We ended up choosing the expenditure to general administration features because they correlated best with the dropout classification data. The data set that we now have only has 4 features and it is ready being tested trough some models. We also used a separate data frame that uses expenditures to instructional staff and dropout rate from 9 to 12 todetermine if a state is southern.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Exploratory Data Analysis \n",
    " \t\n",
    "We will test out model using linear regression at first to see is we can get a correlation in a simple model. Based on the score we may need to switch to other methods. We will switch to classifying the dropout rate. The drop out rates are classified based on exceptionally low drop out rates that 25% of the state contains. We will first use KNN to predicting the classification of the school. The KNN will cluster data of the same property and will hopefully get a prediction the correlation between funds and low drop out rates. We are hoping for 90 to 80% of the values to be classified correctly in the testing data.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to get a solid idea on which data features of out data set correlated with what we used a correlation matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "We found that the dropout rates of grade 11 and the dropout rates of grade 10 correlated the relatively well with the proportion of fewer revenue given to the state.We also examined that the feature that tells if a state is southern or not, correlates well with the proportion of support expenditures to instructional staff. From this data we can test if the proportion federal revenues can be used to predict Dropout rate of grade 10 or dropout rate of grade 11. We may also be able to make a distinction between the proportion of support expenditure to instruction staff and whether of not the state is southern. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    " However to overall correlation are not that great. There were also outliers within our drop out data that could have effected the overall results. Illinois had an unusually high dropout rate one year that we perceived as a miss calculation on the data set. So calculated the average of the other dropout rate in Illinois and replaces that value with the outlier values.\n",
    " \n",
    "We we used the Describe() method from python to find out how we should categorize the Dropout rate, grade 9-12. We saw the the mean of the dropout rate is 3.6, the standard deviation is 1.6, the min is 1.1, the standard deviation at the 25 percentile is 2.4, 50 percentile  is 3.4, and 75 percentile is at 4.5.

    "\n",
    "Also while exploring the data sets, we found signs of correlations between states with higher proportions of their budgets going towards General Administration showing dropping rates between grades 9-12. This showed positive results with knn and lda approaches, but due to the limited categories and average testing scores we decided to focus elsewhere. This did lead to lda scores between .68 and .8."

    "## Machine Learning Approaches\n",
    "\n",
    "### Linear Regression\n",
    "Linear regression works by fitting a line(or plane) to the data with the least square residuals. Linear regression uses regression instead of classification. Linear regression was our initial idea until we realized we had to quantify the data to make a better model. It seems kind of odd to go from classification models to models that deal with continuous data. We first theorized that linear regression was going to be our a good model to start out with. We realized fast that there is not really a good way to get the direct correlation from any x-value that we have in our data set. We expected to see that as changes in funding teacher salaries went down, the dropout rate did as well but the found out there are more factor and that the data set that we are using is too broad at the state level to make those kind of assumption.\n",
    "\n",
    "We tried to use linear regression models to use the amount of federal revenue but it did not work. When we generated a linear model that predicts dropout rates based on federal revenue we got a very low score. This means that we had to pivot into using classifications instead of regression because, it led to better machine learning models. This led us  classify the dropout data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although not successful in most cases we used linear regression, but it dod not turn out s well as we desired. \n",
    "\n",
    "From these machine learning models, we found that having low dropout rate can be effected by the nature of expenditures is spent on the schools general administrating, the expenditure that matter the most are the expenditures to salaries with in the general administration and the expenditures to supplies with the general administrations. We were able to use KNN and logistic regression to predict successful models because we can predict that the likely hood that the dropout rate is below 2.4 gets higher as the expenditures on the general administrations goes up. I theorize that this is because the expenditures to general administration possibly describes the general wealth of a school administration. We were also able to use knn to presisly predict if a state is southern based on dropout rate 9-122 and expenditure to instructional staff.\n",
    "\n",
    "### KNN low dropout rates\n",
    "The K-nearest neighbor algorithm is a simple way to classify data. When we plot the data set, we classify the test value by checking for the majority of the k nearest neighbor on the graph. If K were to equal 2, then it will compare 2 neighbors. KNN is good for classification models because it makes high accurate predictions. If we wanted to accurately depict if the data hits we can use KNN. With our first model of the KNN system, we used 2 as k, this means that the data point will compare its self to 2 of its nearest neighbors. If the majority of those neighbors has a dropout rate under 2.4, then that dat point will be classified as 2.4. We separated the testing and training data with the testing data being 20% of the data set.The random state is 1 and stratify is set to y. The columns from the data base that we used to test the data are the proportion of support expenditures to general administration, support expenditure salaries general administration, and expenditures supplies general administration. When we fit the training data to the data, we got a score of 87%. This looks like a good score for k being 2. However with the method of cross validation, we see which value of k get the moor accurate score. The way that the cross validation works for KNN models is that it takes a range of k values and test the model with that k value. When we do this, we get an array of scores these scores are all of the scores that represent the Kth value. From looking at the array that was displayed we see that the first model that we tested, the model where k = 2 is the best model that has the most accurate score at predicting data. We also have the results of all the k values that is displayed on the line graph. It shows that as k gets higher, the score gets lower in the 70s range. This is because the higher the k value, the higher the variance. So we have to determine the k value that does not gives us too much variance and does not give us too much bias. This means that when we use the features total expenditures to general administration, expenditure to salaries in general administration, and expenditures to supplies in general administration, we are able to use KNN to predict if a states dropout rate is below 2.4 at a 87 percent success rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Logistic Regression\n",
    "We will now use the same data set to predict the drop out rate but we will now use the machine learning method, Logistic regression. We use Logistic regression because it is one of the main models that are used for classification. Logistic is practically the same procedure as linear regression but instead of measuring something continuous, we use it to predict if a feature is true or false. Logistic regression fits a logistic function to the training feature as best as it can to try to predict whether what we are testing is true or false. In logistic regression maximum likely hood is used to calculate if a line or plane can fit to the data. Like linear regression, using too many features will be useless because as we use more dimensions the feature we add does not make an effect on the score of the model. Since we only have 3 feature to test the data, we should be good on not over using features for logistic regression. One of the main reasons why we probably shouldn't be using linear regression is because we do not have that big of a data set. Due to the nature of the data sets, we only have state dropout and finance data from years 2007 to the year 2010. Not having a big data set can lead the model to be misleading so we must keep that in mind based on the score that we get. When we separated the train data and the testing data, we separated based on 20% testing data and the rest training data. After we run the logistic regression, fit and train the data, we get an overall score of 73% which I think that is pretty good for the data set that we have. After we have gotten the first score of 75% we must use cross validation to test other scores. We use 5 fold cross validation to test scores. The K-fold cross validation separate the data into k segments. The segments are tested on the models and gets a score. It is a tool that is used to determine how good the machine learning model is. As a result of the 5-fold learning model, we got 5 different scores but they all range from 70 to 73. We can then confidently say that the lLogistical regression model can use the general administration features to predict whether drop out rate is below 2.4 between getting 70 to 73 percent correctly.   \n",
    "\n",
    "### LDA and QDA\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we will LDA to maximize the separability between the features that we have. LDA maximizes the separability by reducing the dimensions of what being examined. LDA can give us a better score when using logistical regression because the data can be more separable. Over all, applying LDA should in theory, give us a better score. When we initially used LDA we got a score of 75%. This is better than any of the initially cross validation scores that we got from the logistical regression. After we git the initial score we used cross validation to test different scores. We used 5 fold cross validation just like when using cross validation of the logistic regression. The 5-fold cross validation led to a wider range of scores than it did with the logistical regression with 5 scores ranging from 68 to 80 percent. QDA was also used on the training set and we received a score of 73%.\n",
    "\n",
    "## KNN In determining southern states\n",
    "\n",
    "From these machine learning models, we found that having low dropout rate can be effected by the nature of expenditures is spent on the schools general administrating, the expenditure that matter the most are the expenditures to salaries with in the general administration and the expenditures to supplies with the general administrations. We were able to use KNN and logistic regression to predict successful models because we can predict that the likely hood that the dropout rate is below 2.4 gets higher as the expenditures on the general administrations goes up. I theorize that this is because the expenditures to general administration possibly describes the general wealth of a school administration. We were also able to use knn to presisly predict if a state is southern based on dropout rate 9-122 and expenditure to instructional staff.\n",
    "\n",
    "The accuracy in which we did our modeling is questionable due to the lack of data that we have. We were only able to the data from the span of three years so it is hard to determine that our machine learning scores are really as accurate as they are ought to be.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "In this data pipelining research we used the state financial data and dropout data to determine if there is a correlation between finances and dropout rate. We put together the data from the years 2007 to 2010 to create one data frame that contains both financial and dropout data. We then realized that in-order to get an accurate representation of how funds are spent, we would have to calculate how expenditures and revenues are proportioned through out each state. We found that the most important feature had to do with the proportion of expenditure for general administration, the expenditures for instructional staff, whether a state is from the south and if the state has a low dropout date. We were able to use some learning models that could accurately predict dropout rate based on the proportion general administration expediters. We were also able to use machine learning models to predict if a state is southern based on dropout rate and the proportion of expenditure to instruction staff. Over all we found that the increased proportion of general administration expenditures increases that likely hood of a state having a low drop out rate.\n",
